# uttrakhand-wonders
A simple responsive website containing various tourist places in Uttrakhand, 
not only Char Dhams ( Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamnotri) but also few more.
I have used html for designing the page , css for styling the page and javascript.
i have used css media query for making it responsive so the site won't colapse in
small devices like mobile.

Here are some screenshots
